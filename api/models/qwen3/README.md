```

## Thinking Mode Control Commands

### In System Messages:
- Add `/think` to encourage reasoning for that conversation
- Add `/no_think` to discourage extended reasoning

### Example with Mode Control:
```
You are a helpful AI assistant. /think
Engage your step-by-step reasoning capabilities when approaching complex problems to ensure thorough and accurate responses.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Clear**: Use simple, direct language in system prompts
2. **Be Specific**: Define the assistant's role and expected behavior clearly
3. **Consider Context**: Tailor the prompt to your specific use case
4. **Test Iterations**: Try different variations to find what works best
5. **Mode Awareness**: Decide whether you want thinking mode enabled by default

## Technical Notes

- Qwen3 models don't have a default system prompt (unlike Qwen2.5)
- The model can dynamically switch between thinking and non-thinking modes
- System prompts should be stable across multi-turn conversations
- For thinking mode: Use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20
- For non-thinking mode: Use Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20

## Usage Example

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Think step-by-step when approaching complex problems."
    },
    {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Your question here"
    }
]
```
